# reasoning-simulation
Comparing abducting, inducting, and bayesian reasoning in physical simulation

### General
 - Could use rust if I want fast animations
 - Use python if I need machine learning models

### Methods
 - Use openai gym
 - Use deep RL libraries
 - Use physics simulation

### Induction
 - Generate various linear, square, cube laws and see if it fits observed data
 - If match multiple theories, run random experiments to distinguish between them

### Humean
 -
